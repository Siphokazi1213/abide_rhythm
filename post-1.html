            <p>We often treat rest as a reward for finishing our "to-do" list. We tell ourselves we will sit down once the laundry is folded, the emails are sent, and the house is quiet. But if we wait for the world to get quiet, we might never rest.</p>
            
            <blockquote>"But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed." — Luke 5:16</blockquote>

            <p>Jesus didn't withdraw because He had nothing to do. He withdrew because He had *so much* to do. He knew that to pour out, He had to be filled by the Father. Rest isn't a luxury; it's a spiritual necessity. Today, I challenge you to find your "lonely place"—even if it's just five minutes in a parked car or a quiet corner of your kitchen. Abide there.</p>
            <p><em>Selah.</em></p>
