        <article class="scripture-content">
            <p>In the Psalms, we often see the word <em>Selah</em>. Most scholars believe it means to pause and calmly think about what was just said. It is a musical direction, a breath between the notes.</p>
            
            <blockquote>"He says, 'Be still, and know that I am God...'" — Psalm 46:10</blockquote>

            <p>Sometimes the most faithful thing you can do is pause. In the middle of a trial or a transition, our instinct is to run faster. But faith often requires us to stand still and let God be God. A Selah moment isn't wasted time; it's worship. It's an act of faith that says, "I don't have to keep the world spinning; God has it."</p>
            <p><em>Selah.</em></p>
